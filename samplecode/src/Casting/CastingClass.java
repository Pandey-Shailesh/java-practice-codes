	 Casting: 
	 Converting one type of information into another type is called casting
	In java casting is classified into 2 types: 
 	1. Primitive casting 
 	2. Non-primitive casting 
	
	1. Primitive-casting:
	 Converting one data type of information into another data type is called Primitive￾casting 
	 Primitive-casting is classified into 3 types: 
 	1. implicit casting 
 	2. explicit casting 
 	3. Boolean casting 

		1. Implicit casting (Widening casting):
			 Converting lower data type information into higher data type information is 
			called implicit casting. 
			 Implicit casting is also called widening casting, where memory size goes on 
			increasing. 
			byte->short->int->long->double.
			

		2. Explicit casting:
			 Converting higher data type information into lower data type information is 
			called explicit casting. 
			 Explicit casting is also called narrowing casting, where memory size goes on 
			decreasing. 
			 In explicit casting data may loss takes place 
 			double->long->int->short->byte

		3. Boolean casting:
			 Boolean casting is considered to be incompatible casting type, because 
			Boolean data type is unique type of data type where information is already 
			predeclared inside it. 
 				boolean str = true 
		     "NOT SUPPORT IN JAVA."
		
	2. Non-primitive casting 
	 converting one type of class into another type of class is called non-primitive 
	casting.
 	non-primitive is classified into 2 types: 
 	1. Up casting (**) 
 	2. Down casting 
	
		1. up casting:
			 Assigning subclass property into superclass is called upcasting. 
			 Before performing upcasting 1st we need to perform inheritance operation. 
			 After performing inheritance, the property which are present inside 
			superclass comes into subclass 
			 In the subclass programmer can declare new properties. 
			 At the time of upcasting operation the properties which are inherited from 
			superclass are only eligible for the upcasting operation. 
			 The new property which was declared inside subclass are not eligible for 
			upcasting operation. 

		2. Down casting:
			 Assigning superclass property into subclass is called down casting. 
			 Before performing down casting 1st, we need to perform upcasting.
