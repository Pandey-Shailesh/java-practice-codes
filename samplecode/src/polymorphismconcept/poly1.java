 	It is one of the OOPs principle where one object showing different behavior 
	at different stages of life cycle. 
	 Polymorphism is a Latin word where poly stand for many & morphism 
	stands for forms. 
	 In java Polymorphism is classified into 2 types: 
 	1. Compiletime Polymorphism 
 	2. Runtime Polymorphism 
	
	==============1. Compiletime Polymorphism:============== 
	1. Compiletime Polymorphism:
	 In Compiletime Polymorphism method declaration is going to get binded to 
	its definition at compilation time, based on argument/input/parameter is 
	known as compiletime Polymorphism. 
	 As binding takes during compilation time only, so it is also known as early 
	binding. 
	 Once binding is done, rebinding can't be done, so it is called static binding.
	 Method overloading is an example of compiletime Polymorphism
	
	==============Method overloading:==============
	Method overloading: 
	Declaring multiple method with same method name but with different 
	argument/parameter/inputs in a same class is called method overloading.
	
	Static method:->initialization at the time of compilation.
	(the static method is declared in the static pool area.)
	non-Static method:->initialization at the time of object creation (Execution).
	(the non-static method is declared in the Heap area.)
	
	

	=================2. Runtime Polymorphism: ================

	2. Runtime Polymorphism: 
	 In Runtime Polymorphism method declaration is going to get binded to its 
	definition at Runtime/execution time, based on object creation is known as 
	runtime Polymorphism. 
	 As binding takes during Runtime/execution time, so it is also known as late 
	binding. 
	 Once binding is done, rebinding can be done, so it is called dynamic binding. 
	 Method overriding is an example of Runtime Polymorphism. 
	
	==================Method overriding: ================
	Method overriding: 
	Acquiring super class method into sub class with the help of extends keyword & 
	changing implementation/definition according to subclass specification is called 
	method overriding
	
	It is only use with Non-Static method, not with static method .
	
	Overriding is the combine effect of Polymorphism and Inheritance.
	
	

	=======Method declaration Process==============
	1.Binding Process
	-held in compilation or Execution time using some parameter
	2.Intialization  Process
	-It is process at which method is ready to call.
	static method  (compilation)
	non-static method (Execution)
